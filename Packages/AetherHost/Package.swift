/*
 * AetherEngine, for the app to link, pinned to one commit: the engine ships
 * its FFmpeg build with it, and the app is tested against one.
 *
 * The commit is on the app's fork (mickey2266/AetherEngine, branch
 * `aiostreams-7.66`): upstream 7.66.0 plus the fork's own commits, replayed
 * from `aiostreams-7.65` unchanged (their hashes there in brackets).
 * - 16c9c6ff (772eab9f): the engine's software player (interlaced H.264 and the like)
 *   labelled 7.1 MPEG_7_1_C, which put the side and rear surrounds in each
 *   other's speakers; it now labels it WAVE_7_1 (Dolby's TrueHD 7.1 channel
 *   check on a Samsung HW-Q990F). The AVPlayer route's FLAC bridge was right
 *   as upstream has it.
 * - 3dc95218 (47fe312e): for remuxes, a 64 MB read-ahead window and 128 MB ranges (were
 *   16 MB and 32 MB); a connection the reader waits on for 8 s below the
 *   video's mean rate is replaced (3 in a row, then the check rests 2
 *   minutes); `confirmsAtmosOnHeldSourceConnection`, so the Atmos
 *   confirmation runs on the held connection the app uses by default.
 * - 736288dd (9d335577): the silent Atmos stream the engine plays beside a rendered
 *   TrueHD Atmos or DTS:X bed stops while the picture-in-picture window
 *   shows, as the bed played nothing in the window beside it.
 * - f42cf7dd (62e221f4): a forward seek past the read-ahead is read through the live
 *   connection up to what the link delivers in a new request's first-byte time
 *   (8 to 32 MB, was a fixed 8 MB); `prefetchLandings(atSeconds:)`, which holds
 *   the bytes a skip lands on ahead of the skip, from the page's skip segments.
 * Back to an upstream version once those are released there.
 *
 * TrueHD Atmos and DTS:X object rendering (`TrueHDObjectAudio`,
 * `DTSXObjectAudio`) are built in, for the page's Object audio switch (off by
 * default, `AetherPlayer.options`); TrueHD brings LibTrueHD with it. Without
 * the switch the app plays TrueHD and DTS-HD as 7.1 PCM, as Infuse does.
 * `DolbyVisionFelCurves` is built in too, for the page's Dolby Vision profile 7
 * FEL switch (off by default, `AetherPlayer.options`): the engine's fold of a
 * FEL enhancement layer into the profile 8.1 curves is on by default with that
 * trait, so the app turns it off unless the switch is on. The other optional
 * components (Dolby Vision dual layer, still reshaping) stay off. XcodeGen can't set a package's traits, which is why this package exists.
